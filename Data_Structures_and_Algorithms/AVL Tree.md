# AVL Tree

A self-balancing balanced binary search tree that strictly enforces balance after every insertion/deletion.

AVL tree got its name after its inventor Georgy Adelson-Velsky and Landis.

Since it is a type of [balanced binary tree](<Balanced Binary Tree.md>) __all balance factors are either 0, 1, or -1 for each node__.

All operations on an AVL tree take `O(log n)` time, where n is the number of nodes in the tree.  
Space complexity for all operations is `O(n)`
