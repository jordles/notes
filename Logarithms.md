# Logarithms

Logarithms are opposites of exponentials. They are the inverse of exponentials.

In Big O notation, log always means log~2~

log~10~100 = 2 (How many 10s do we multiply together to get 100?)
log~2~100 = 5 (How many 2s do we multiply together to get 100?)

2^3^ = 8 <=> log~2~8 = 3 (How many 2s do we multiply together to get 8?)
