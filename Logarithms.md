# Logarithms

Logarithms are opposites of exponentials. They are the inverse of exponentials.

log<sub>2</sub>(value) = exponent => 2<sup>exponent</sup> = value

In Big O notation, log always means log<sub>2</sub>
It roughly measures the number of times you can divide that number by 2 before you get a value that's less than or equal to one. 

log~10~100 = 2 (How many 10s do we multiply together to get 100?)
log~2~100 = 5 (How many 2s do we multiply together to get 100?)

2<sup>3</sup> = 8 <=> log<sub>2</sub>8 = 3 (How many 2s do we multiply together to get 8?)
