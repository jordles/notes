# AI

Computer programs that can complete cognitive tasks typically associated with human intelligence. 

AI has existed for awhile now. Some examples of early implementations include recommendation systems, chatbots, and image recognition systems.

AI is also a broad field that includes machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, computer vision, robotics, and more.

AI is powered by __machine learning__ algorithms, which allow it to learn from data and improve its performance over time. These algorithms can be trained on large datasets to recognize patterns, make predictions, and perform tasks that would be difficult or impossible for humans to do manually.

Machine learning is a subset of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions based on data. It involves training models on large datasets to recognize patterns and make decisions without being explicitly programmed. Its often used by AI to make sense of large amounts of data and to automate tasks that would be difficult or impossible for humans to do manually.
