# AI

Computer programs that can complete cognitive tasks typically associated with human intelligence. 

AI has existed for awhile now. Some examples of early implementations include recommendation systems, chatbots, and image recognition systems.

AI is also a broad field that includes machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, computer vision, robotics, and more.

AI is powered by __machine learning__ algorithms, which allow it to learn from data and improve its performance over time. These algorithms can be trained on large datasets to recognize patterns, make predictions, and perform tasks that would be difficult or impossible for humans to do manually.

Machine learning is a subset of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions based on data. It involves training models on large datasets to recognize patterns and make decisions without being explicitly programmed. Its often used by AI to make sense of large amounts of data and to automate tasks that would be difficult or impossible for humans to do manually.

Machine Learning is built using __Training Sets__, which are datasets that are used to train the model / AI. The model is then tested on a separate dataset called the Test Set, which is used to evaluate the performance of the model. The model is then fine-tuned based on the results of the test set.

__Training sets__ provide ML programs with examples of what to expect and how to respond. 

# AI development techniques

__Artificial intelligence__ refers to computer programs that can complete cognitive tasks typically associated with human intelligence. There are two main techniques used to design AI programs:

- __Rule-based techniques__ involve creating AI programs that strictly follow predefined rules to make decisions. For example, a spam filter using rule-based techniques might block emails that contain specific keywords using its predefined logic.

- __Machine learning techniques__ involve creating AI programs that can analyze and learn from patterns in data to make independent decisions. For example, a spam filter using these techniques might flag potential spam for the recipient to review, preventing automatic blocking. If the recipient marks emails from trusted sources as safe, the spam filter learns and adapts its logic to include similar emails from that sender in the future.

In general, __rule-based techniques__ are commonly used for tasks that require rigidity, such as blocking messages from untrusted senders that are obviously spam, like requests for bank transfers or private information. 

Conversely, __ML techniques__ are better suited for tasks demanding flexibility and adaptability, like learning to recognize that messages from trusted senders containing typos are not spam.

# Approaches to training ML programs

__Supervised learning__

Using  this approach, AI designers provide the ML program with a labeled training set of data, and the program learns from that data. A labeled training set includes data that is labeled or tagged, which provides context and meaning to the data. For instance, an email spam filter that's trained with supervised learning would use a training set of emails that are labeled as “spam” or “not spam.” ==Supervised learning is often used when there's a specific output in mind.==

__Unsupervised learning__

In this approach, AI designers provide the ML program with an unlabeled training set of data, and the program learns from that data. An unlabeled training set includes data that does not have labels or tags. For instance, ML might be used to analyze a dataset of unsorted  email messages and find patterns in topics, keywords, or contacts. In other words, ==unsupervised learning is used to identify patterns in data without a specific output in mind.==

__Reinforcement learning__

In this approach, AI designers provide the ML program with data that allow it to learn by  trial-and-error. The program learns to do this by getting rewarded for making good choices that lead to the desired results. ==Reinforcement learning is commonly used by conversational AI tools. As these tools receive feedback from users and AI designers, they learn to generate effective responses.==

Each ML technique has its own strengths and weaknesses. Depending on the type of data that's available and what's needed to solve the particular problem, AI designers may use one, two, or all three of these techniques to produce an AI-powered solution.

# Generative AI

__Generative AI__ is a type of AI that can create new content, such as text, images, or music, based on the patterns it has learned from the training data. It uses techniques like deep learning and neural networks to generate new content that is similar to the training data.

Generative AI is able to understand natural language. Heres the process: 
  1. Provide input
  2. Data is processed
  3. Output is generated 

__Natural Language__ refers to the way humans communicate with each other using spoken or written language. It includes the use of words, phrases, and sentences to convey meaning and express ideas. Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of AI that focuses on enabling machines to understand and interpret human language.

> Advancements in supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning have helped pave the way for __generative AI__ —AI that can generate new content, like text, images, or other media. When users provide input in the form of a __prompt__ —text input that provides instructions to the AI model on how to generate output—the AI tool processes this input to generate new content.

> For instance, all three approaches play distinct roles in conversational AI tools. Supervised learning equips conversational AI tools with foundational dialogue data, enabling them to respond to common conversational cues appropriately. Unsupervised learning enables them to interpret nuances in language, like colloquialisms, that occur naturally in conversation. Reinforcement learning further strengthens these tools by allowing them to improve their responses in real-time based on user feedback. This enables them to adapt to the conversational context and engage in natural conversations.

Benefits of generative AI include:
- **Efficiency**: It can automate content creation, saving time and resources.
- **Personalization**: It can generate tailored content based on user preferences and behavior.
- **Better decision-making**: It can analyze large datasets and generate insights that help businesses make informed decisions.
