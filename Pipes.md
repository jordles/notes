# 🧲 1️⃣ Corrosion & Rust Prevention (Longevity & Protection Hierarchy)
| Rank | Material / Product Type | Main Use | Water Resistance | Durability |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 🥇 | Anti-seize compound (nickel/copper-based) | Prevents galling, rust, and seizure on metal-to-metal threads | ✅ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| 🥈 | Silicone grease / plumber's grease | Lubricates and protects metal, rubber, and plastic from moisture | ✅ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| 🥉 | Dielectric grease | Similar to silicone grease, but slightly thicker and optimized for electrical insulation | ✅ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| 4️⃣ | Petroleum-based greases (lithium, marine grease) | Lubricates and protects metal, not safe for rubber/plastic | ✅ | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| 5️⃣ | WD-40 / penetrating oils | Temporary moisture displacement and rust loosening | ❌ | ⭐ |
| 6️⃣ | Light oils (3-in-One, mineral oil) | Mild lubricant, some corrosion protection | ❌ | ⭐ |

✅ Summary (Best to Worst for Preventing Rust/Seizing):

Anti-seize compound > Silicone grease ≈ Dielectric grease > Marine grease > WD-40 / light oils


# 💧 2️⃣ Water Leakage Prevention (Seal Integrity Hierarchy)
| Rank | Material / Product Type | Main Use | Pressure Rated |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1️⃣ | Pipe thread sealant paste (PTFE-based / Teflon paste) | Seals threaded connections under pressure | ✅ (high) |
| 2️⃣ | PTFE (Teflon) tape | Thread sealing on water, air, gas lines | ✅ (medium-high) |
| 3️⃣ | Anaerobic thread sealant (Loctite 545, 567, etc.) | Cures in absence of air, bonds metal threads | ✅ (very high) |
| 4️⃣ | Pipe dope (non-PTFE variants) | Old-style sealant, oil-based | ⚠️ |
| 5️⃣ | Silicone grease / plumber’s grease | Lubrication only | ❌ |
| 6️⃣ | Anti-seize compound | Corrosion prevention only | ❌ |
| 7️⃣ | WD-40 / oils | Penetrant only | ❌ |

✅ Summary (Best to Worst for Preventing Water Leaks):

Thread sealant paste (PTFE) > Teflon tape > Anaerobic sealant > (big gap) > Everything else
