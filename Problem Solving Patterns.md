# Problem Solving Patterns

## [Frequency Counters](<Frequency Counters>)

This pattern uses objects or sets to collect values/frequencies of values. This is because accessing objects or sets is O(1) constant time. Using objects is much easier to place a counter as a value, compared to arrays.

This can often avoid the need for nested loops or O(n^2) operations with arrays/strings

Using multiple for loops instead of nested loops is much more efficient.
