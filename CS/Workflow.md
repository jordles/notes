Show how data moves through a system (no decision logic).

A DFD is a visual tool used to map how data moves through a system—where it comes from, how it's processed, where it’s stored, and where it ultimately goes. It outlines the flow of information between different components such as sources, processes, databases, and outputs. DFDs are valuable for analyzing existing systems, designing new ones, and aligning technical and non-technical stakeholders around how data is handled across an organization.

__Logical DFDs__: These diagrams focus on what data is being processed and moved in the system, without emphasizing the specific technology used. They represent the business processes and the data required and produced by those processes.

__Physical DFDs__: These diagrams illustrate how the data flow is implemented, including specific hardware, software, files, and personnel involved in the data processing and storage. They provide a more technical perspective on the system and are often used during the design and implementation phases.

| Symbol | Meaning | Notes | Examples | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 🔵 (circles or rounded rectangles) | Process | Show where data is transformed or interacted upon within the system; Transforms inputs to outputs | Transform Event Data, Sync to CRM |
| 🟧 (open-ended rectangles or parallel lines) | Data Store / Storage | Where data is held (e.g., DB table) | User Profiles, Sales Database |
| 🟩 (rectangles) | External Entity | Source/destination outside the system that provide input or consume output | Mobile App, Payment Gateway |
| ➡️ (directional arrows)| Data Flow | Arrows show movement of data. Each arrow is labeled to describe the type of data in transit. | Order Info, User Events |

✅ Good for:
- Understanding logical flow
- Requirement validation
- Showing system boundaries

__Diagram Levels__:  
- Level 0 DFDs, are context diagrams, the most basic data flow diagrams. Easily digestable but providing little detail. Level 0 data flow diagrams show a single process node and its connections to external entities.  
- Level 1 DFDs are more detailed and can be used to show the logical flow of data within a system. Process nodes from the context diagram is broken down into sub-processes. As these processes are added, the diagram will need additional data flows and data stores to link them together.  
- Level 2 DFDs are more complex and provide a more in-depth view of the system's architecture. Simply break processes down into more detailed sub-processes. In theory, DFDs could go beyond level 3, but they rarely do. Level 3 data flow diagrams are detailed enough that it doesn’t usually make sense to break them down further.

# Unified Modelling Language

[More here](https://www.lucidchart.com/blog/types-of-UML-diagrams)

UMLs describe how users interact with the system

UML is a standardized modeling language that can be used across different programming languages and development processes, so the majority of software developers will understand it and be able to apply it to their work.

UML standards identify 13 types of diagrams that are divided into two groups, defined below:

__Structural UML diagrams__, as the name would suggest, show how the system is structured, including the classes, objects, packages, components, etc. in the system and the relationships between those elements.

- __Class Diagrams__ focus on the classes and their relationships within the system (OOP). Class diagrams show the static structure of a system, including classes, their attributes and behaviors, and the relationships between each class.

- __Component Diagrams__ is a more specialized version of the class diagram (same notation rules). It shows the structure of a system, including components, their attributes and behaviors, and the relationships between each component.

    </details>

- __Deployment Diagrams__ shows how software is deployed on hardware components, such as servers, databases, and storage devices. Describes servers, network, runtime environments, and other hardware components. These diagrams are most useful for systems engineers, and they usually show performance, scalability, maintainability, and portability. When hardware components are displayed in relation to each other, it’s easier to keep track of your entire hardware mesh and make sure that all elements are accounted for in a deployment.

- __Composite Structure Diagrams__ Shows the internal structure of a class or component, including its parts, ports, and connectors. They are blueprints for the internal structure of a classifier. They can also be used to show the behavior of a collaboration or the classifier interactions with their environments through ports. They can easily depict the internal components of any hardware to more thoroughly understand the inner workings. It acts as a look inside a given structured classifier, defining its configuration classes, interfaces, packages, and the relationships between them at a micro-level.

# Flowchart

**Flowchart** is a diagrammatic representation of a process or workflow. It is a visual representation of a series of steps or actions that are executed in a specific order to achieve a specific outcome. In computer science, we use flowcharts for designing algorithms, data structures, and software applications.

A **flowchart** is a diagram used to illustrate the steps of an algorithm. Flowcharts are made up of symbols, each containing a single step of the algorithm. The shape of the symbol represents the type of process that the symbol contains.

A **process flow diagram (PFD)** is a visual representation of a process, showing the sequence of steps and decisions involved in completing a task or achieving a goal. It's a type of flowchart that uses symbols, shapes, and arrows to illustrate the flow of information or material through a system. PFDs are commonly used in engineering, business, and other fields to document, analyze, and improve processes.

- Terminator Block - The oval block used for the start and end of a flowchart. You can use words like 'Start', 'Begin', 'End' inside the terminator shape to make things more obvious.
- Process Block - A block of code that performs a specific task or action. Part of a flowchart that tells the program what action to take. Use rectangles to capture process steps like basic tasks or actions in your process
- Decision Block - The diamond-shaped block used for YES/NO questions. These blocks have two outputs: 1 (for yes) and 2 (for no).
- Input/Output Block - The parallelogram block used for user input and system output. These blocks have two outputs: 1 (for input) and 2 (for output).

**Data Blocks** are used to store data or information.
They are used to:

- Represent a data structure (e.g., an object or class)
- Show data that’s created, modified, or read
- Clarify where data is coming from or what it looks like
- Document data relationships for databases, file formats, APIs

Example: Login Logic Flowchart (Web App)
