# Documentation

Developers can't only be responsible for writing code but also:
- Document how the program runs
- Provide clear instructions for operations teams, support engineers, or automated systems
- Ensure that if something goes wrong, others know how to fix it or recover data

These docs bridge the gap between programmers and operators

They're essential for:

- DevOps teams
- Large-scale applications
- Automated systems and SLAs

## Job Narratives
- A written overview of what a program, job, or process is designed to do
- It is a guide for users, developers, and support staff
- To describe the purpose, steps, and expected outcomes of a job/process

## Flowcharts

You can learn more [here](<Flowchart.md>)

We visualize the control flow and the data flow of a program.

## Run Instructions 

- A step-by-step guide on how to start, monitor, and stop the program/job
- Ensures consistent execution, even by someone who didn't write the code

## Error Procedures

- A document explaining how to handle known issues or common failures
- Reduces downtime by giving operators and developers a clear way to troubleshoot

## Recovery Procedures

- A documented way to recover data, system state, or application integrity after a failure
- Ensures data integrity and system continuity in case of system crash or data loss
