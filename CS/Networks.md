# Networks

## How the internet works: 
- A __network__ is a collection of nodes (computers) and edges (connections between the nodes).  
- A __computer__ is a node and the connection between two computers is an edge. Computers allow us to transfer data
- A __network switch__ allows a computer to communicate with other computers
- A network switch can connect to other network switches, which allows two networks to communicate (connect)
- An __interconnected network__ is a network that is connected to each other, also known as the __internet__
- The __client-server model__ is the most common type of network. Where the client is the browser and the server is the web server


## What is a web server:
- A __web server__ is a computer that responds to requests from __web browsers__
- A __data center__ is a network of servers, that run a variety of applications(servers) on the internet. They need power, internet connections, and are kept cool up to 24 hours a day
- Data centers are built based on the service purpose. If it is for storing images, it might have a lot of hard drive space. If it is for storing data/or doing complex calculations, it might have a lot of RAM and a faster processor. The physical components of a server is known as the __server hardware__.
- A code that runs on hardware is known as the server software
- Web servers are used to store and serve web pages. They can handle: Website storage and administration, Data storage, Security, and Managing Email.
- __request response cycle__ - the process of sending a request to a server and getting a response back. (this is different from the client-server model as the model is more of an umbrella term describing architectural relationships between clients and servers)

## Websites vs Webpages
- A webpage is a document that displays images, texts, videos and other content in the web browser. In its simplest form, a webpage is a text document.
- A website is a collection of webpages
- A webpage can also link to other websites, so webpages don't have to relate to each other

- HTML (HyperText Markup Language) - it uses markup tags to describe the content of a webpage. The way HTML describes the content is known as markup

- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) - it is a style sheet language used to style the presentation of a document written in HTML

- Javascript - JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. They are used to add interactivity to web pages

- Every time we update our code, we send a request to the server. A copy of your webpage is sent to the server, and the server sends it back to you.

- Through page rendering, the server sends the HTML to the browser. The browser renders the HTML(page content) to the webpage
