| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Function                                | A reusable block of code that performs a task                                               |
| Parameter vs Argument                   | Parameter = placeholder in a function; Argument = actual value passed                       |
| Variable Scope                          | Where a variable is accessible (global, local/block)                                        |
| Return Value                            | What a function gives back after execution                                                  |

| Mutable/Immutable                       | Whether a value can be changed (objects = mutable, strings = immutable)                     |
| API (Application Programming Interface) | A set of functions or rules for interacting with a system or program                        |
| Runtime vs Compile Time                 | When code runs vs when it is translated (JS is interpreted, not compiled)                   |
| Syntax vs Semantics                     | Syntax = code structure, Semantics = meaning/logic                                          |

| Program                                 | a set of instructions that a computer follows to perform a task; also known as software.    |
| Algorithm                               | A step-by-step method for solving a problem or performing a computation.                    |
| Data structure                          | A format for organizing and storing data (e.g., array, stack, queue, tree, hash table).     |
| Abstraction                             | Hiding implementation details and showing only the necessary features.                      |
| Encapsulation                           | Binding data and methods that manipulate that data within a single unit (class/object).     |
| Compiler                                | Translates source code into machine code.                                                   |
| Interpreter                             | Executes code line-by-line without compiling.                                               |
| Runtime                                 | The time period when a program is running. Includes memory management, execution flow, etc. |
| Operating System (OS)                   | Software that manages computer hardware and software resources.                             |
| Concurrency                             | Multiple processes/threads running simultaneously (often in parallel).                      |
| Networking                              | The exchange of data between devices (e.g., using TCP/IP).                                  |
| Process                                 | An instance of a program in execution.                                                      |
| Thread                                  | The smallest unit of execution within a process.                                            |

| Throughput                              | The amount of work a system can process in a given time.                                    |
| Scalability                             | A system’s ability to handle growth (e.g., users, data, traffic).                           |
| Fault tolerance                         | The ability of a system to continue operating when components fail.                         |


### 3 Basic Logic Structures that describe how to write code in Programming:
1. __Sequence;__ An action or event leads to another action or event in a predetermined order. The sequence can contain any number of actions, but cannot be skipped. 
2. __Selection;__ Referring to if-then-else statements and logic. Depending on the answer, the program takes one of two courses of action, after which the program moves on to the next event.
3. __Iteration;__ describes the logic of loops. A set of instructions that the program repeats until a condition is met or count is reached. Each pass in a loop is called an iteration. 

## Operating Systems

Operating Systems:
Process vs Thread – Units of execution; thread is part of a process.  
Scheduling – How CPU time is divided among processes (FCFS, Round Robin, etc.)  
Memory Management – Virtual memory, paging, segmentation.  
File Systems – FAT, NTFS, ext4 — how data is stored and organized.  
System Calls – How user programs interact with the OS.  
Multitasking / Context Switching – How OS handles multiple running processes.
