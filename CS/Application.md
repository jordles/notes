Frameworks and libraries
- A framework is a collection of libraries that work together to provide a certain functionality. A library is a collection of reusable code. Some frameworks/libraries are open source meaning they are freely available for anyone to modify and build from.
- A library is a collection of reusable code that can be used in multiple applications. They are built to provide a specific functionality, like for example a library for validating email addresses. Developers save time and money by reusing code thats already been written.
- Frameworks provide a structure for developers to build with. Frameworks can handle functionality that is common to all web applications such as receiving HTTP requests and sending HTTP responses. You can see it like a blueprint for developers to input their code onto.
- Frameworks are considered opinionated, while libraries are not. The benefit of frameworks is that they can replace libraries as needed. They define the flow and control of an application, whereas libraries are left to the developer to decide.
