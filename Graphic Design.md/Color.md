__Primary Colors__ are used to create the color palette. They are the base colors, and cannot be created from other colors.

__Secondary Colors__ are made by combining primary colors to create new colors. 

__Tertiary Colors__ are created by combining secondary colors with primary colors to create new colors.

__Neutral Colors__ help to balance/contrast the color palette. They are usually gray, white, and black.

__Accent Colors__ are used to highlight specific elements in a design.
