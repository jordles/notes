# Design Process

## Known Design Principles
Double Diamond Design Process - a way to group elements to create a cohesive design.
It is split into 2 spaces; A Problem space and a Solution space:

- Discover
- Define
- Develop
- Deliver

## Steps of the Design Process

- Learn and Plan: Understand the problem, gather requirements, and create a plan.
- Design and Iterate: Design and iterate through different iterations of the design.
- Build and Launch: Build and launch the final design, think about distribution.
- Reassess and Improve: Reassess and improve the design based on user feedback.

Role-Specific Focus:
- Marketers: Aligning designs with campaign objectives and audience engagement.
- Creatives: Emphasizing creative expression and visual storytelling. 

__Identify the client's needs:__
- Who is the client? Conduct research to understand their identity. 
  - Examples of Activities:
    - Marketing a new product
    - Reviving and updating an old product
    - Website hosting geared toward young audiences
    - Sports manufacturing (outdoors, winter sports, summer sports)

__Understanding Project purpose:__
- Clarify why the project exists
- Align project's objectives with the client's goals
  - Examples of Activities:
    - Review the client's purpose for the new campaign.
    - Assess existing marketing materials or create new ones as needed.

__Competitor Analysis:__
- Identify and understand the competition.
- Analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the competition.



3. Which of the following are not part of the project plan? 

- Project milestones and deliverables
- ==Budget and resource allocation==
- Schedule and deadlines

    We cant plan for budget and resource allocation, but we can plan for milestones and deliverables.

4. During which phase are the system set up for monitoring the main three elements of the project plan (scop,e schedule, and costs)?

- Initiation phase
- Execution phase
- ==Planning and Analysis phase==
- Closure phase


## Development Frameworks

Time Based Development (Jira, Scrum) - more about the time

Project Based Development (waterfall, kanban) - more about the deliverables.

Waterfall - give deliverables all at once before getting feedback on iteration. Rigid and not very flexible. Identify sequential stages and key deliverables.
  - Discover 
  - Design
  - Develop
  - Test

Agile - gather feedback and iterate as needed. Short development cycles, called sprints. Define the first sprint goal and how feedback will be incorporated. 

Lean - Deliver value quickly, maximum/optimize potential and resources. MVP, MDP ( Minimum Desirable Product). Highlight key taks that deliver immediate value while reducing waste. 

__Waterfall is often used for tried and tested projects. Lean is often used for product design and manufacturing and Agile is used for bespoke solutions.__
