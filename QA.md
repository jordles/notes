# QA Testing

QA testing provides stakeholders with valuable insights into the quality and performance of software applications. It helps identify defects, ensure compliance with requirements, and improve user satisfaction. Ensure the quality of the software and the business requirements, ultimately satisfying the end users.

There are two types of QA testing: manual and automated.

## Manual Testing
Manual testing involves human testers who execute test cases without the use of automation tools. This type of testing is essential for exploratory, usability, and ad-hoc testing where human intuition and experience are crucial.

Types of Testing in Manual QA:  

- 🔎 Exploratory Testing  
- 📋 Test Case Execution  
- 🧪 Usability Testing  
- 📱 Cross-browser & Cross-device Testing  
- 🎯 Ad-hoc Testing


Tools: 

	- TestRail
  - Jira
  - Postman (for API manual testing)
  - Excel/Google Sheets
  - Browser dev tools

## Automated Testing
Automated testing uses software tools to run tests on the application. It is efficient for regression testing
and repetitive tasks, allowing for faster execution and more consistent results. Automated tests can be written in various programming languages and frameworks, such as Selenium for web applications or JUnit for Java applications.
