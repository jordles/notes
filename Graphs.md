# Graphs

A non-linear data structure that models relationships between objects. It consists of two main components: Vertices (nodes) and Edges. 

**Vertices (Nodes)** - are the objects that are represented in the graph. They are the entities of the graph.

**Edges** - are the connections between vertices. They are the links between the vertices and represent the relationships between them.

**How do we represent a graph?**

[**Adjacency Matrix**](#adjacency-matrix) - a matrix that shows the connections between the vertices. It is a 2D array where the rows and columns represent the vertices and the values represent the edges.

**Adjacency List** - a list that shows the connections between the vertices. It is a dictionary where the keys represent the vertices and the values represent the edges.

**Edge List** - a list that shows the connections between the vertices. It is a list of tuples where the first element is the source vertex and the second element is the destination vertex.
