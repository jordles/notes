# Interview Prep (Whiteboard Questions)

## Understand the Problem
1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
2. What are the inputs that go into the problem? data types?
3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution? data types?
4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do the inputs fully determine the outputs? Do you have enough information to solve the problem?
5. How should I label important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?

## Explore Concrete Examples
Features:
User Stories - User Action -> Expected Output
Unit Test - Input -> Expected Output

* Start out with simple examples
* Progress to more complex examples
* Explore with empty inputs
* Explore with invalid inputs

## Break it Down
Write out the steps you need to take (pseudo code)

## Solve/Simplify
If we can solve the problem, solve a simpler problem. Ignore the part thats giving you a hard time, and focus on the parts that are easy to solve. (make any progress to showcase your problem solving skills, which is much better than showing you're stuck and not making any progress)

If you truly don't know, don't be afraid to ask questions on how you would solve it to your interviewer, because at least you are solving your problem solving skills. 

## Look Back and Refactor
