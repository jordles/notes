# OOP (Object Oriented Programming)

Javascript's OOP model is based on prototypes.  
Prototypes are used to add properties and methods to an object.  
Any javascript object can link (known as reference) to another object through the prototype chain.

`Object.create(myPrototypeObject)` is used to create an object that links to a prototype object.
If a property is not found on the object, it will look for the property on the prototype object. If it is not found on the prototype object, it will look for the property on the prototype's prototype object and so on up the prototype chain.

There are 3 ways to create objects in Javascript:

1. Object Literal (Simple Object)
2. Constructor Function 
3. Class

<details>
<summary>Object Literals</summary>
By definition, an object is object-oriented, but it lacks all the core features of the oop principles.

```js
const person = {
  name: "Alice",
  greet() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
  }
};

person.greet(); // Hello, my name is Alice
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Constructor Functions</summary>

Our way of writing javascript objects is through __constructor functions__ instead of classes which use class functions.

Privacy is enforced through closures. Closures are used to create private variables and methods, since they dont have `this` keyword attached they cant be accessed from outside the function.

When we create a `new` instance of a constructor function, the `this` keyword points to the new object that is created.

1. Creates an empty object
2. Sets the `this` keyword to the new object
3. Links the new object to the prototype object
4. Returns the new object  

This effectively binds `this` to a new instance.

Any method or property that is defined on the prototype is shared across all instances of the constructor function.
Those defined on the function itself are unique to each instance, so instances with the same functions for example, dont share those methods, but they each have their own private variables and methods versions. 

Defining methods on a prototype is <ins>more memory efficient</ins> than defining them on the function itself since each instance only has a single copy of the method instead of its own unique copy. This is not an issue on classes, since all properties and methods are automatically placed on the prototype.


```js
// üß± Base Constructor (Animal)
function Animal(name, age) {
  this.name = name;       // Public
  this.age = age;         // Public

  let _mood = "neutral";  // üîê Private via closure (Encapsulation)

  // üß† Public method to access private _mood (Abstraction)
  this.getMood = function () {
    return _mood;
  };

  this.setMood = function (newMood) {
    if (typeof newMood === "string") {
      _mood = newMood;
    }
  };
}

// üß† Public method defined on prototype (shared across all animals)
Animal.prototype.speak = function () {
  console.log(`${this.name} makes a sound.`);
};

Animal.prototype.info = function () {
  console.log(`${this.name} is ${this.age} years old and feeling ${this.getMood()}.`);
};

// üêï Child Constructor (Dog)
function Dog(name, age, breed) {
  Animal.call(this, name, age); // üß¨ Inheritance (call super constructor)
  this.breed = breed;
}

// üîó Inherit from Animal's prototype, this is similar to extends from javascript classes
Dog.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);
Dog.prototype.constructor = Dog;

// üêï Polymorphism: override speak()
Dog.prototype.speak = function () {
  console.log(`${this.name} the ${this.breed} barks loudly!`);
};

// üêà Child Constructor (Cat)
function Cat(name, age, breed) {
  Animal.call(this, name, age);
  this.breed = breed;
}

// Inherit from Animal
Cat.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);
Cat.prototype.constructor = Cat;

// üêà Polymorphism: override speak()
Cat.prototype.speak = function () {
  console.log(`${this.name} the ${this.breed} meows softly.`);
};
```

| Concept	| ES6 Classes | Constructor Functions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Inheritance Syntax | extends	| Object.create() + call |
| Method Sharing | via super + prototype chain | via prototype chain |
| Parent Constructor | Call	super()	| Parent.call(this) | 

This example is a more direct translation of a class to constructor functions.

```js
class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  speak() {
    console.log(`${this.name} makes a sound`);
  }
}
```

```js
function Animal(name) {
  this.name = name;
}
Animal.prototype.speak = function() {
  console.log(`${this.name} makes a sound`);
};
```

**HERES WHERE CLASSES COME INTO PLAY** as they provide a syntax sugar for creating objects with shared properties and methods.

## OOP Principles (PAIN)
### Polymorphism, Abstraction, Inheritance, E(n)capsulation

‚úÖ [Encapsulation](#encapsulation) is the hiding  
‚úÖ [Abstraction](#abstraction) is the showing  
‚úÖ [Inheritance](#inheritance) is the reuse   
‚úÖ [Polymorphism](#polymorphism) is the many forms  

[More Examples](#examples)

## Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the ability for an object to decide what information is shown to the outside world and what information it keeps to itself. It encourages methods that specify how certain properties are accessed or modified.

Private variables (limited and controlled access) and methods like **getters** and **setters** are the implementation of encapsulation.

There are two ways to implement private variables:

1. `#` syntax is enforced by the compiler
2. `_` syntax is not enforced by the compiler, but is recognized by devs as private

`static` keyword is used to create static methods. Static methods are methods that are called on the class itself, not on instances of the class.

**Getters** and **Setters** are used to access and modify private variables in a controlled way. For private methods, use public methods to expose them through abstraction.

Use a **getter** when:

- You want to expose a value as a property.
- The user shouldn‚Äôt need to know that logic is being run under the hood.
- The result feels like data, <ins>not an action</ins>.

Private ensure:
1. Prevent external access ‚Äî users shouldn't rely on its behavior.
2. Allow internal changes ‚Äî you can modify or replace the method's logic without affecting the rest of your codebase.
3. Protect integrity - you can ensure that the state of the object is consistent.

<details>
<summary>Encapsulation Examples</summary>

```js
class BankAccount {
	#balance; // Private field encapsulating balance

	constructor(owner, balance) {
		this.owner = owner;
		this.#balance = balance;
	}

	deposit(amount) {
		if (amount > 0) this.#balance += amount;
	}

	getBalance() {
		return this.#balance;
	}
}

const account = new BankAccount("Alice", 1000);
account.deposit(500);
console.log(account.getBalance()); // 1500
// account.#balance = 0; ‚ùå Error: Private field
// console.log(account.#balance); Error: Private field
```
</details>

## Abstraction

Abstraction is about hiding complexity and exposing a clean, usable interface. It is a way of representing only the important parts of an object and hiding the less important parts.  
<ins>This means abstraction requires encapsulation for it to expose to the user, a clean interface, by hiding complexity first.</ins>

Abstraction is achieved through:

| Technique                     | How It Contributes to Abstraction                                            |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Private fields/methods (#)    | Hide implementation details from outside the class.                          |
| Getters/Setters               | Control access to private data‚Äîonly expose what's needed, maybe validate it. |
| Public methods                | Expose a simplified and meaningful interface.                                |
| Avoiding unnecessary exposure | Don't show internal workings like helper methods unless needed.              |

<details>
<summary>Abstraction Examples</summary>

```js
class CoffeeMachine {
  #powerOn() { //encapsulating the power on process
    console.log("Warming up...");
  }

  #brew() { // encapsulating the brewing process
    console.log("Brewing coffee...");
  }

  makeCoffee() {
    this.#powerOn();
    this.#brew();
    console.log("Here‚Äôs your coffee ‚òï");
  }
}

const machine = new CoffeeMachine();
machine.makeCoffee();

// Here, abstraction hides the detailed process of powering on and brewing, 
// exposing only the high-level makeCoffee() method that simplifies the interface.
```
</details>

## Inheritance

Inheritance is the ability for a class to inherit properties and methods from another class. It allows you to reuse code and create a hierarchy of classes. 

There is also a prototype-based inheritance called **prototypal inheritance** not based on javascript classes, and its actually how javascript objects inherit properties and methods from other objects.

Parent Classes are called __Superclasses__ and Child Classes are called __Subclasses__.

`extends` keyword is used to inherit properties and methods from a parent class.  
`super` keyword calls on the parent class to access its methods and properties. Its another way to reuse code, so that you don't have to repeat yourself.

There are two ways to use `super`:
- **`super()`** calls the constructor of the parent class.
- **`super.method()`** calls a method of the parent class

<details>
<summary>Inheritance Examples</summary>

```js
class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  speak() {
    return `${this.name} makes a noise.`;
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  constructor(name, breed) {
    super(name); // ‚úÖ Calls the Animal constructor with the name
    this.breed = breed;
  }

  speak() {
    // ‚úÖ Calls the parent class speak() method
    const parentMessage = super.speak(); 
    return `${parentMessage} ${this.name} barks.`;
  }
}
```

</details>

## Polymorphism

Polymorphic code is when you have multiple functions with the same name and similar interfaces (objects => methods and properties; functions => parameters and values), but they have different uses or implementations. It allows objects of different types to be used interchangeably.

Polymorphism provides a way to perform a single action in different forms/ways. It provides the ability to call the same method on different Javascript objects.  
<ins>__You can call the same methods on different objects, but get different behaviors.__</ins>

There are two types of polymorphism:
- __Method/Function Overloading__: Multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. (different behavior based on parameters)
- __Method/Function Overriding__: Multiple methods with the same name but different implementations. (different behavior based on implementation / object)

Its important to know javascript doesnt have a way to do function overloading, but we can simulate it. 
<details>
<summary>Method Overloading</summary>

```js
class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  feed(food, quantity) {
    if (quantity === undefined) {
      console.log(`${this.name} is eating ${food}.`);
    } else {
      console.log(`${this.name} is eating ${quantity} portions of ${food}.`);
    }
  }

  //we can also use rest parameters
  // feed(...args) {
  //   const [food, quantity] = args;
  //   if (quantity) {
  //     console.log(`${this.name} is eating ${quantity} portions of ${food}.`);
  //   } else {
  //     console.log(`${this.name} is eating ${food}.`);
  //   }
  // }
}

```
Method overloading can be done on java classes by creating multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.

The compiler knows which version of the feed() method to call based on the number and types of arguments. This is called __compile-time polymorphism__ or __static polymorphism__.  

If this was written the same way for javascript, only the last method would be called because method names must be unique and it goes in the order of declaration. For javascript we have to combine all the logic with specific parameters and use conditional statements to call the correct method.  


```java
public class Animal {

    String name;

    // Constructor
    public Animal(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    // Overloaded methods
    public void feed(String food) {
        System.out.println(name + " is eating " + food + ".");
    }

    public void feed(String food, int quantity) {
        System.out.println(name + " is eating " + quantity + " portions of " + food + ".");
    }

    public void feed(int quantity, String food) {
        System.out.println(name + " is gobbling " + quantity + "x " + food + " enthusiastically!");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal dog = new Animal("Rex");

        dog.feed("kibble");
        // Rex is eating kibble.

        dog.feed("kibble", 2);
        // Rex is eating 2 portions of kibble.

        dog.feed(5, "treats");
        // Rex is gobbling 5x treats enthusiastically!
    }
}
```

</details>


<details>
<summary>Method Overriding</summary>

```js
class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  speak() {
    console.log(`${this.name} makes a generic animal sound.`);
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  speak() {
    console.log(`${this.name} barks.`);
  }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
  speak() {
    console.log(`${this.name} meows.`);
  }
}

// All animals:
const animals = [
  new Dog("Rex"),
  new Cat("Whiskers"),
  new Animal("Mysterious")
];

// Call speak on each ‚Äî runtime polymorphism in action
animals.forEach(animal => animal.speak());
```

Function overriding includes overriding methods with the same name but different parameters. This is different than function overloading, which produces different implementation based on parameters.

```js
//this is still function overriding
// overriding the speak method with different parameters

class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  feed(food) {
    console.log(`${this.name} is eating ${food}.`);
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  feed(food, quantity) {
    console.log(`${this.name} is eating ${quantity} portions of ${food}.`);
  }
}
```

### Examples

```js
// Base Class: Vehicle (Encapsulation, Abstraction)
class Vehicle {
	#fuelLevel; // Encapsulating fuel level

	constructor(fuelLevel = 0) {
		this.#fuelLevel = fuelLevel;
	}

	// Private method to refill the fuel (Encapsulation)
	#refill(amount) {
		if (amount > 0) {
			this.#fuelLevel += amount;
			console.log(`Refilled ${amount} liters.`);
		}
	}

	// Abstraction: Refuel is abstracted, users only interact with it via public method
	refuel(amount) {
		this.#refill(amount); // Hiding the complexity of refueling
	}

	// Method to check fuel (Abstraction: showing essential details only)
	getFuelLevel() {
		return this.#fuelLevel;
	}

	// Start method, to be overridden in subclasses (Polymorphism)
	start() {
		console.log("Vehicle is starting...");
	}
}

// Derived Class: Car (Inheritance, Polymorphism)
class Car extends Vehicle {
	constructor(fuelLevel) {
		super(fuelLevel); // Inheriting from Vehicle
	}

	start() {
		console.log("Car is starting... Vroom Vroom!");
	}
}

// Derived Class: Bike (Inheritance, Polymorphism)
class Bike extends Vehicle {
	constructor(fuelLevel) {
		super(fuelLevel); // Inheriting from Vehicle
	}

	start() {
		console.log("Bike is starting... Vroom!");
	}
}

// Example of Usage
const car = new Car(10);
car.start(); // Car is starting... Vroom Vroom!
car.refuel(5);
console.log("Car fuel level:", car.getFuelLevel()); // Car fuel level: 15

const bike = new Bike(5);
bike.start(); // Bike is starting... Vroom!
bike.refuel(2);
console.log("Bike fuel level:", bike.getFuelLevel()); // Bike fuel level: 7
```
