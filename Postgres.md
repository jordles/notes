# Postgres (PostgreSQL)

Postgres is one of the most popular open source relational databases. It is a SQL database that supports ACID transactions and is written in C. It is also known as PostgreSQL.

PostgreSQL is the database server itself. When you install PostgreSQL locally or run it in a Docker container, you're setting up a database server that listens for connections (e.g., on localhost:5432).

PostgreSQL does not come with a graphical user interface (GUI) for managing the database. Instead, you use tools like:  
**pgAdmin**: A web-based GUI for managing PostgreSQL databases (similar to MongoDB Compass for MongoDB).  
**psql**: A command-line tool for interacting with PostgreSQL databases.

**MongoDB Compass:**  
MongoDB Compass is a GUI tool for managing MongoDB databases. It connects to a MongoDB server, which can be running locally, in a Docker container, or on a remote cloud service like MongoDB Atlas. PostgreSQL Does Not Have a Built-In Remote Cloud Service.
MongoDB Compass is not the database server itself—it's just a client application for interacting with the database.

**Self-Hosted PostgreSQL:**

Install PostgreSQL on your local machine, a virtual machine, or a Docker container.
Manage the database yourself, including backups, scaling, and security.

**Cloud-Hosted PostgreSQL:**

Use a cloud provider to host your PostgreSQL database. Popular options include:

- Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL (AWS)
- Google Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL (GCP)
- Azure Database for PostgreSQL (Microsoft Azure)
- Heroku Postgres (Heroku)

**Third-Party Services:**
Services like ElephantSQL or Supabase provide managed PostgreSQL hosting with features like backups, scaling, and monitoring.

Important questions to ask?

1. What kind of thing are we storing?
2. What properties does it have?
3. Type of data for each of those properties?

Postgres uses tables to store data.

---

## Keys

**Primary Keys** - Identifies unique rows in a table.  
**Foreign Keys** - Identifies/references unique rows in another table. It helps us connect the data between tables. Usually 'many' side gets the foreign key column of the other tables. Foreign keys are always checked for consistency, and will return an error if they are not consistent (foreign key constraints). Any action will be interrupted until the foreign key is consistent. If we dont have a foreign key ready yet, the null value can be used to indicate this relationship does not exist yet. You can specify delete behavior using

### When we try to delete a row that has a foreign key:

1. **DELETE RESTRICT** => Throws an error.
2. **DELETE NO ACTION** => Throw an error.
3. **DELETE CASCADE** => Delete the row that has a foreign key.
4. **DELETE SET NULL** => Set the foreign key column to null.
5. **DELETE SET DEFAULT** => Set the foreign key column to the default value, if one is provided.

Data Consistency - Data is consistent and line up with each other.

## Relationships

| Relationships | Description  |
| ------------- | ------------ |
| 1:1           | One-to-one   |
| 1:N           | One-to-many  |
| N:1           | Many-to-one  |
| N:N           | Many-to-many |

### Schema Designs

├── [Polymorphic Association](#polymorphic-association)  
├── [Single Table Inheritance](#single-table-inheritance-multiple-foreign-key-columns)  
└── [Concrete Table Inheritance (Association Table per Model)](#concrete-table-inheritance-join-table-per-association)

What should you choose? Well if specificity matters, then go for concrete table inheritance of association tables. Between those two, If these specifics are even more specified, then go for association table per model.

Something like likes for both posts or comments, is more appropriate with concrete table inheritance. Reaction type liking is more appropriate for association table per model since those likes are more specific and different and warrant multiple tables.

We should consider other factors like:

- **optimizing** - as association table per model is more performant, because we can isolate the specific table for optimizing, instead of running queries on a cumulative table. Association table per model offers more flexible changes at the table level, since each type has its own and changes wont affect the other types.

- **complexity of queries** - if we only require a very general query pertaining to all types, then go for polymorphic association. Otherwise, go for concrete table inheritance of association tables. An example is hashtags, which is really only used in social media apps under a search feature. For instagram in particular, we need to separate the model for posts, from comments and users, since its search feature is focused on hashtags for posts. This implies concrete table inheritance for posts only, but since its the only one with queries being needed, its really just the single table being created.

### Join Tables
__AKA Junction Tables or Association Tables__  

A table that connects two tables together. It is used to represent many-to-many relationships.  

Join tables is often used to __reduce the number of queries and improve performance__. If we have a many-to-many relationship, we can often repeat the same data in multiple tables. Instead of doing a query for each table, we can join the tables together and get the data we need in a single query. This can be done using a join table.

| **hashtags** |
| ------------ |

| id  | title  |
| --- | ------ |
| 1   | cat    |
| 2   | dog    |
| 3   | catdog |

| **hashtags_posts** | 
| ------------------ |
<!-- storing integers for hashtags is more space efficient than storing strings, esp for repeated data. -->
| id  | hashtag_id | post_id |
| --- | ---------- | ------- |
| 1   | 1          | 1       |
| 2   | 2          | 1       |
| 3   | 2          | 2       |

| **posts** |
| -------- |

| id | url | user_id |
| -- | --- | ------- |
| 1  | ... | 1       |
| 2  | ... | 1       |
| 3  | ... | 2       |

### Polymorphic Association

**Polymorphic Association** - One table column can be associated with multiple tables. This method can't use foreign key columns. Instead, it uses a discriminator column. This method is an alternative to using many foreign key columns in one table, assuming those foreign key columns all reference the same column.

However, its not recommended in data designs like postgres which require its foreign key relationships to exist beforehand to ensure data consistency, so its not common to see. This design is however common with **Ruby on Rails** for example.

#### A polymorphic table will typically have:

**target_id** – the primary key of the associated record; no longer a foreign key column since it can reference multiple tables

**target_type** – the name of the associated table/model

✅ Pros:

- Reduces duplication (no need for post_likes, comment_likes, etc.)
- Flexible and extensible

❌ Cons:

- Harder to enforce foreign key constraints, which can lead to data inconsistency
- Queries can get more complex, causing a performance penalty.

_`the likes table here showcases a liked_type for posts and comments, because both those tables have likes functionality`_
| **likes** |
|---------------------------------------|

| id  | user_id | liked_id | liked_type |
| --- | ------- | -------- | ---------- |
| 1   | 3       | 2        | post       |
| 2   | 3       | 1        | comment    |
| 3   | 4       | 2        | post       |
| 4   | 4       | 1        | comment    |

### Single Table Inheritance (Multiple Foreign Key Columns)

We implement multiple separate foreign key columns instead, and have the rest be filled with nulls to represent the type for that row.

| **likes** |
| --------- |

| id  | user_id | post_id | comment_id |
| --- | ------- | ------- | ---------- |
| 1   | 3       | 2       | NULL       |
| 2   | 3       | NULL    | 1          |
| 3   | 4       | 2       | NULL       |
| 4   | 4       | 1       | NULL       |

❌ Cons:

- Not flexible; What if we allow more types of likes in the future?

To ensure correct data consistency, we need to add a check to ensure that only one of the columns is not null.

```sql

CREATE TABLE likes (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
  post_id INTEGER,
  comment_id INTEGER,
  CHECK (post_id IS NOT NULL OR comment_id IS NOT NULL)
);

-- OR

CREATE TABLE likes (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
  post_id INTEGER REFERENCES posts(id),
  comment_id INTEGER REFERENCES comments(id),
  CHECK (COALESCE((post_id)::BOOLEAN::INTEGER, 0) + COALESCE((comment_id)::BOOLEAN::INTEGER, 0) = 1)
)

-- OR

ALTER TABLE likes
ADD CHECK (COALESCE((post_id)::BOOLEAN::INTEGER, 0) + COALESCE((comment_id)::BOOLEAN::INTEGER, 0) = 1);

-- keep in mind, type casting a null value to boolean or integer will result in null. But if you type cast a non-null value to boolean or integer, it will result in 1.
---

```

### Concrete Table Inheritance (Join Table per Association)

We can create a join table per association. This is the most common method for creating a many-to-many relationship.

| posts_likes |
| ----------- |

| id  | user_id | post_id |
| --- | ------- | ------- |
| 1   | 3       | 2       |
| 2   | 3       | 1       |
| 3   | 4       | 2       |
| 4   | 4       | 1       |

| comments_likes |
| -------------- |

| id  | user_id | comment_id |
| --- | ------- | ---------- |
| 1   | 3       | 2          |
| 2   | 3       | 1          |
| 3   | 4       | 2          |
| 4   | 4       | 1          |

So if users can like posts and comments. We can create a separate table for each association.

✅ Pros:

- Allows us to set specific constraints on every association, compared to the limitations of using one table for all associations. It also allows us to easily branch those association tables, into other nested association tables.

❌ Cons:

- Not flexible; What if we allow more types of likes in the future? We would need to create more association tables.
- If you want the total number of likes involving posts and comments, you'd need to do a union or a view, which is more complex.

```sql
-- union of post_likes and comment_likes to get the total number of likes
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_likes
FROM (
  SELECT user_id FROM post_likes
  UNION ALL
  SELECT user_id FROM comment_likes
) AS all_likes;

-- sum the count from each query
SELECT
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM post_likes) +
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM comment_likes) AS total_likes;

-- create a view (template)
CREATE VIEW all_likes AS
SELECT user_id, post_id AS liked_item_id, 'post' AS liked_type FROM post_likes
UNION ALL
SELECT user_id, comment_id AS liked_item_id, 'comment' AS liked_type FROM comment_likes;

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM all_likes;
```

## Data Types

**General Rules:**

(There is no performance difference)

- id column of any table is SERIAL.

### Integer

- Storing a number without decimals is INTEGER.
- Storing a number with decimals and it needs to be exact is NUMERIC.
- Storing a number with decimals and the decimal doesn't matter is DOUBLE PRECISION.

### Boolean

- `True, 'yes', on, 1, 't', 'y'` = true.
- `False, 'no', off, 0, 'f', 'n'` = false
- `NULL` = null

### Time

We can perform operations on time data types.

- `TIME` = any time format w/o timezone, also accepts am or pm
- `TIME WITH TIME ZONE` = any time format, also accepts am or pm, must include timezone ex: `01:23:23 AM UTC` outputs `01:23:23+00:00`
- `TIMESTAMP` = any date and time, also accepts am or pm
- `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE` = any date and time with timezone, also accepts am or pm, must include timezone ex: `NOV 20 1980 01:24 AM PST` outputs `1980-11-20 02:23:00-07`

### Interval

Intervals are especially useful when working or doing calculations with time. We can subtract 1 day from a specific date. You can also perform calculations on the interval itself `SELECT INTERVAL '2 days' - INTERVAL '1 day';` or `SELECT INTERVAL '2 days' * 2;`  
We can also use it in conditions: `SELECT * FROM events WHERE duration > INTERVAL '2 days';`

- `1 day` / `1d` = 1 day
- `1 hour` = 1 hour
- `1d 1m 1s` = 1 day 1 minute 1 second

### Null

Null is not an actual value, as it represents an unknown value. So equality statements do not work with null. Use IS NULL to check for null values.

### Constraints

To find your constraints of a table, use pgAdmin to inspect those constraints or this query:

```sql
SELECT conname AS constraint_name, contype AS constraint_type,
       pg_get_constraintdef(oid) AS definition
FROM pg_constraint
WHERE conrelid = 'your_table_name'::regclass;
```

### [Aggregate Functions](#grouping-and-aggregating) <a id="aggregate-function"></a>

Aggregate Functions are functions that are applied to a group of data in columns. It reduces rows to a single row and therefore take in columns.

| Aggregate Functions                 | Description                                                  |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| COUNT()                             | Count the number of rows in a table. Does not work with NULL |
| SUM()                               | Sum the values in a column.                                  |
| AVG()                               | Calculate the average value in a column.                     |
| MIN()                               | Find the minimum value in a column.                          |
| MAX()                               | Find the maximum value in a column.                          |
| STDDEV()                            | Calculate the standard deviation of a column.                |
| VAR()                               | Calculate the variance of a column.                          |
| STRING_AGG (column name, delimiter) | Aggregate data into a single string.                         |
| ARRAY_AGG (column name)             | Aggregate data into an array.                                |

### Row Level Functions

Row Level Functions are functions that are applied to each row of data. It reads a single row at a time.

| Row Level Functions               | Description                                                 |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| [GREATEST()](#greatest-and-least) | Returns the largest value from a list of values in the row  |
| LEAST()                           | Returns the smallest value from a list of values in the row |

### SQL Query Execution Order

When interacting with a database, theres an order that SQL follows:  
1️⃣ FROM → Determine the source tables  
2️⃣ JOIN / ON → Apply joins between tables (ON condition comes before the JOIN keyword)  
3️⃣ WHERE → Filter rows after joins  
4️⃣ GROUP BY → Group rows together (Aggregate functions are applied here after grouping)  
5️⃣ HAVING → Filter groups  
6️⃣ SELECT → Choose columns to return  
7️⃣ DISTINCT → Remove duplicate rows  
8️⃣ ORDER BY → Sort the final result  
9️⃣ LIMIT / OFFSET → Limit the number of rows (by convention, limit is placed before offset)

**Keywords** - tell the database what we want to do. Its always written in CAPITAL LETTERS.  
**Identifiers** - tell the database what this is called. Its always written in lowercase.

## Validation

| Web Server                                      | Database                                                                              |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Easier to express more complex validation       | Validation still applied even if you connect with a different client                  |
| Far easier to apply new validation rules        | Guaranteed that validation is always applied at the database level (through a schema) |
| Many libraryies handle validation automatically | Can only apply new validation rules if all existing rows satisfy the rule             |

**Web Server:**

- ✅ **Easier to express more complex validation**  
  Web servers can use JavaScript logic or validation libraries like Joi, Validator.js, or Express-Validator to enforce complex rules (e.g., password strength, email formats, business logic).

- ✅ **Far easier to apply new validation rules**  
  Validation logic can be updated without affecting existing data in the database.  
  Example: If you want to enforce a stronger password policy, you can just update the validation logic in Express without modifying the database.

- ✅ **Many libraries handle validation automatically**  
  Example: If you're using Mongoose (for MongoDB) or Sequelize (for SQL), they have built-in validation rules for schemas, making it easier to enforce consistency.

- ❌ Validation at the web server level only works if every client follows the API rules.

- ❌ If someone connects directly to the database (e.g., through psql or another API), they could bypass these checks.

**Database:**

Database-level validation ensures data integrity, even if a client bypasses the web server.

- ✅ **Validation is always applied**  
  If someone directly connects to PostgreSQL using psql, pgAdmin, or another tool, the database enforces constraints.
- ✅ **Guaranteed schema enforcement**  
  Constraints like NOT NULL, UNIQUE, CHECK, and FOREIGN KEY always apply, preventing bad data from entering the database.
- ✅ **Ensures consistency across multiple clients**  
  Even if multiple services write to the same database, all of them must follow database constraints.

- ❌ **Applying new validation rules is harder**  
  If you add a new validation rule on an existing table, all existing rows must comply before the change is allowed.

- ❌ **Complex validations are harder**  
  PostgreSQL constraints work well for basic validation (e.g., NOT NULL, CHECK), but complex rules (like "password must contain a special character") are better handled at the web server level.

**Best practice: <ins>Use both</ins>.**

**Web Server (Express/Node.js)**: Handles business logic and complex validations.

**Database (PostgreSQL)**: Ensures data integrity and prevents bad data at the lowest level.

## Postgres Examples

```sql

-- keywords  identifiers
CREATE TABLE cities(
  -- column name data type
  name VARCHAR(50),
  country VARCHAR(50),
  population INTEGER,
  area INTEGER
);

-- inserting data to our table
INSERT INTO cities (name, country, population, area)
VALUES
  ('Tokyo', 'Japan', 38505000, 8223),
  ('Delhi', 'India', 28125000, 2240),
  ('Shanghai', 'China', 21715000, 1628),
  ('Sao Paulo', 'Brazil', 21272000, 9449);

-- retrieving data from our table
SELECT * FROM cities;
SELECT area, name, name, country FROM cities;

-- do some calculation using math operations and use AS to name a new column for it
SELECT name, population/area AS density FROM cities;

-- using || for concatenation and labeling its new column as location.
SELECT name || ' is a city in ' || country AS location FROM cities;

-- using CONCAT() for concatenation and labeling its new column as location.
SELECT UPPER(CONCAT(name, ' is a city in ', country)) AS location FROM cities;

-- using WHERE to filter data
SELECT name, ara FROM cities WHERE area > 4000;

-- using comparison operators
SELECT name, area FROM cities WHERE area BETWEEN 2000 AND 4000;
SELECT name, area FROM cities WHERE name IN ('Delhi', 'Shanghai');
SELECT name, area FROM cities WHERE area NOT IN (3043, 8223) OR name = 'Delhi';
SELECT name, population / area AS population_density FROM cities WHERE population / area > 6000; -- we cannot use population_density for comparison because its not a column name.

--to use the alias column name:

-- 1. Use a Subquery:
-- SELECT name, population_density
-- FROM (
--     SELECT name, population / area AS population_density
--     FROM cities
-- ) subquery
-- WHERE population_density > 6000;

-- 2. Use a CTE (Common Table Expression):
-- WITH city_data AS (
--     SELECT name, population / area AS population_density
--     FROM cities
-- )
-- SELECT name, population_density
-- FROM city_data
-- WHERE population_density > 6000;
```

```sql
-- updating data in our table (update does not return the updated row or our data)
UPDATE cities SET population = 39505000 WHERE name = 'Tokyo';
```

```sql
-- deleting data in our table (delete does not return the deleted row or our data)
DELETE FROM cities WHERE name = 'Tokyo';
```

```sql
-- find the ids of the top five most liked posts
SELECT posts.id
FROM posts
JOIN likes ON posts.id = likes.post_id
GROUP BY posts.id
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

### Keys

```sql
-- create table with primary keys
CREATE TABLE users(id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(50));

-- create table with foreign keys and specify delete behavior
CREATE TABLE photos(
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  url VARCHAR(200),
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

-- insert values with foreign keys, they must exist on the foreign key table otherwise place a null value or else there will be an error.
INSERT INTO
  photos (url, user_id)
VALUES
  ('https://one.jpg', 4),
  ('http://two.jpg', 1),
  ('http://25.jpg', 1),
  ('http://36.jpg', NULL),
  ('http://754.jpg', 2),
  ('http://35.jpg', 3),
  ('http://256.jpg', 4);

-- retrieve data with foreign keys
SELECT * FROM photos WHERE user_id = 4;

--depending on delete behavior actions this can produce different outcomes on relational databases
DELETE from users WHERE id = 1;
```

### Joins

All **JOINS** queries will match and fill up the combined corresponding number of rows in our combined tables with null values if there is no matching data. Order will matter for directional joins based on which table is on the left and which table is on the right of the JOIN keyword.

REMEMBER **ON** is the matching condition applied to every row, starting from the left initial table matching to the right. ON essentially orders the rows according to its condition. THIS NOT NOT MEAN **ON** WILL ENFORCE SERIAL ORDERING.

Although **ON** is similar to **WHERE** for filtering data, **WHERE** happens after the **JOIN**, which when dealing with outer joins will turn it into an inner join instead, when it detects **NULL** values for example. Placing the condition on **ON** will retain the unmatched rows with NULL values, due to **ON** being executed first before **JOIN**.

| Feature                     | JOIN                                                     | UNION                                                                   |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Purpose                     | Combines columns from multiple tables                    | Combines rows from multiple queries                                     |
| When to Use                 | When you need data from related tables with a common key | When you need to merge results from two queries with the same structure |
| Number of Columns in Output | Can be different for each table                          | Must be the same for both queries                                       |

```sql
--select specifies the columns we want to retrieve from the 3rd imaginary table we created by joining tables. Select determines the order of these columns, if non are specified, then the order is based on the table order stated in the query. Select columns must be unique, and if they are the same name, you must specify the table name with dot notation (if certain libraries are still unable to recognize the difference use the AS keyword to rename a column or even rename a table itself).
SELECT contents, username FROM comments
-- the tables join physically side by side with all the same column names on a 3rd imaginary table.
JOIN users ON users.id = comments.user_id;


-- using a left join to specify the null values in our combined table.
INSERT INTO PHOTOS (url, user_id)
VALUES ('https://null.jpg', NULL),

SELECT url, username
FROM PHOTOS
LEFT JOIN users ON users.id = photos.user_id;

-- using a full join
INSERT INTO USERS (username)
VALUES ('Nicole');

SELECT url, username
FROM PHOTOS
FULL JOIN users ON users.id = photos.user_id;

-- using WHERE to filter data on our JOINed table, we are looking for the user that commented on its own photo
SELECT url, contents
FROM comments
JOIN photos ON photos.id = comments.photo_id
WHERE comments.user_id = photos.user_id;

-- using a three way join to combine 3 tables, we use a join condition so theres no need to use a WHERE for our use case
-- use case is were trying to find the user that commented on their own photo and find their username.
SELECT url, contents, username
FROM comments
JOIN photos ON photos.id = comments.photo_id
JOIN users ON users.id = comments.user_id AND users.id = photos.user_id;
```

### Grouping and Aggregating

**Grouping** is a way to combine data from multiple rows into a single row.

Grouping names unique values as its own rows (buckets), and reorders the data to be grouped under these buckets. We can only select the newly made GROUP BY column names in our SELECT statement, any other will give an error or we can select the column produced by an aggregate function.

**Aggregation** is a way to combine data from multiple rows into a single value.
We can use the following [aggregate functions](#aggregate-function).

```sql
-- using group by to get grouped data based on user_id and aggregate to find the total count of id within the grouped data.
-- Useful for finding a total number of something a user has done for example.
-- We use COUNT(*) to count the number of rows in our table more accurately, than relying on the column which might have null values.
SELECT user_id, COUNT(*) AS num_comments_created
FROM comments
GROUP BY user_id;

-- using aggregate functions on select which produces a column with the name of the aggregate function
SELECT MIN(user_id) FROM comments;

-- Find the number of comments for each photo (comments has a photo_id foreign key)
SELECT photo_id, COUNT(*)
FROM comments
GROUP BY photo_id;

-- We want to print the author's name and the number of books they have written.
-- Reminder that joining comes first, which creates the combined rows for our conjoined table, which is then grouped and later aggregated by count.
SELECT name, COUNT(*)
FROM books
JOIN authors ON authors.id = books.author_id
GROUP BY name;

-- Find the photos where its photo_id is less than 3 and its total count is greater than 2.
SELECT photo_id, COUNT(*)
FROM comments
WHERE photo_id < 3
GROUP BY photo_id HAVING COUNT(*) > 2;

-- find users where the user has commented on the first 2 photos and the user added more than 2 comments on those photos
SELECT user_id, COUNT(*)
FROM comments
WHERE photo_id = 1 OR photo_id = 2
GROUP BY user_id HAVING COUNT(*) > 2;

-- find users where the user has commented on the first 50 photos and the user has added more than 20 comments on those photos

SELECT user_id, COUNT(*)
FROM comments
WHERE photo_id <= 50 AND photo_id > 0
GROUP BY user_id HAVING COUNT(*) > 20;

-- Given a table of phones, print the names of manufacturers and total revenue (price * units_sold) for all phones.  Only print the manufacturers who have revenue greater than 2,000,000 for all the phones they sold.
SELECT manufacturer, SUM(price * units_sold)
FROM phones
GROUP BY manufacturer HAVING SUM(price * units_sold) > 2000000;
```

### Order By

```sql
-- order by multiple criterias on different columns. If price has the same value, order by weight in descending order
SELECT *
FROM products
ORDER BY price, weight DESC;


```

### Limits and Offsets

```sql
-- these queries are useful for pagination, with offsets that are increased while the limit shows the number of rows to return per page

-- limit the number of rows returned from a query
SELECT *
FROM products
LIMIT 5;

-- offset the number of rows returned from a query
SELECT *
FROM products
OFFSET 5;

-- order and limit to get the first 5 rows but skip the first result
SELECT *
FROM products
ORDER BY price
LIMIT 5
OFFSET 1;
```

### Unions

Although ORDER BY allows us to order by multiple columns, the latter columns are dependent on the previous columns. Unions orders multiple columns by combining 2 or more queries together. Parenthesis is necessary if you have multiple query keywords (ORDER BY, LIMIT, etc.) in the same line, because SQL does not know the order of the keywords or which query it is referring to.

Unions must always have the same number of columns, and data types. If the columns are the same name, they will default to the first query's column(s).

```sql
-- combine 2 or more queries together and order by the combined columns

SELECT manufacturer
FROM phones
WHERE price < 170

UNION

SELECT manufacturer
FROM phones
GROUP BY manufacturer
HAVING COUNT(*) > 2

(
  SELECT *
  FROM products
  ORDER BY price DESC
  LIMIT 4
)
UNION ALL
(
  SELECT *
  FROM products
  ORDER BY price/weight DESC
  LIMIT 4
);

-- remember 'intersect all' implies either queries have duplicates (in itself) in order for the duplicate to show. Show commonalities between the queries.

(
  SELECT *
  FROM products
  ORDER BY price DESC
  LIMIT 4
)
INTERSECT ALL
(
  SELECT *
  FROM products
  ORDER BY price/weight DESC
  LIMIT 4
);

-- except removes commonalities between the queries, showing only unique values from the first query.

(
  SELECT id, name
  FROM products
  ORDER BY price DESC
  LIMIT 4
)
EXCEPT
(
  SELECT id, name
  FROM products
  ORDER BY price/weight DESC
  LIMIT 6
);
```

### Subqueries

Place a query inside another query. You dont need a semicolon for the end of the inner query statement, but instead the end of the overall query statement. Keep in mind, we can insert subqueries anywhere in the query, but we do have to consider what it returns for the query to make sense.

You can always place an alias for your subqueries with the AS keyword outside of the parenthesis, useful if your environment does not support columns with the same name.

Why not use join or union instead?

JOIN combines columns from different tables based on a condition, but you're working within a single table and only need a filtered subset of rows.
UNION is for combining results from multiple queries, but here, you only need to filter rows from one table.

Understanding the shapes of data:

```sql
-- SELECT * FROM orders => many rows, many columns
-- SELECT id FROM orders => Many rows, one column
-- SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders => Single value (1 row, 1 column)

-- SELECT with no FROM => Single value (1 row, 1 column)
-- ex: SELECT(SELECT MAX(price) FROM products), (SELECT AVG(price) FROM products);

-- FROM statements must always have an alias applied to it. If you dont, you will get an error.

-- JOIN clauses must always have its subquery compatible with the ON clause conditions and must have a table alias applied to it.

-- WHERE clauses is where subqueries are commonly used. Whatever subqueries placed in here must match the corresponding WHERE clause conditions stated. For example, IN operator only takes in one column. Sometimes a JOIN clause can do the same thing were a WHERE clause does. Performance for both are the same.

-- > < >= <= = != <> are all single values
-- IN , NOT IN, >/</>=/<=/=/ <> ALL/SOME/ANY are all single columns

-------------------------

-- example of a subquery
SELECT name, price, price / (SELECT MAX(price) FROM phones) AS price_ratio
FROM phones;

-- example of using single values; make sure structure of data stays consistent.
SELECT *
FROM (SELECT MAX(price) FROM products) AS p;
--find the average number of orders for all users

--method 1
SELECT AVG(order_count)
FROM (
  SELECT user_id, COUNT(*) AS order_count
  FROM orders
  GROUP BY user_id;
) AS p;

--method 2; 2 separate queries
CREATE TEMP TABLE temp_order_counts AS
SELECT user_id, COUNT(*) AS order_count
FROM orders
GROUP BY user_id;

SELECT AVG(order_count)
FROM temp_order_counts;

-- calculate the average price of phones for each manufacturer, then print the highest average price.

SELECT MAX(price) AS max_average_price
FROM
(
    SELECT manufacturer, AVG(price) AS price
    FROM phones
    GROUP BY manufacturer
);


-- join subqueries are not common, and much more easier to deal with than nested subqueries.

-- method 1 ; filters then join
SELECT first_name
FROM users
JOIN (
  SELECT user_id
  FROM orders
  WHERE product_id = 3
) AS o
ON users.id = o.user_id;

-- method 2 ; join then filters
SELECT users.first_name
FROM users
JOIN orders ON users.id = orders.user_id
WHERE orders.product_id = 3;

-- print out the name and price of phones where the price is greater than the S5620 Monte

-- method 1
SELECT name, price
FROM phones
WHERE price >
(
    SELECT price
    FROM phones
    WHERE name = 'S5620 Monte'
);

-- method 2
SELECT p1.name, p1.price
FROM phones p1
JOIN phones p2 ON p2.name = 'S5620 Monte'
WHERE p1.price > p2.price;

-- using > ALL for our query
-- Show the name, department, and price of products that are more expensive than all products in the industrial department; we could have just found the max(price) instead as well.
SELECT name, department, price
FROM products
WHERE price > ALL (
  SELECT price FROM products WHERE department = 'Industrial'
)

-- Show the name of products that are more expensive than at least one product in the industrial department.

SELECT name
FROM products
WHERE price > ANY (
  SELECT price FROM products WHERE department = 'Industrial'
)

--show the name of products that are more expensive than at least one product in the 'Industrial' department or at least one product in the 'Electronics' department.

SELECT name, department, price
FROM products
WHERE price > ANY (
  SELECT price FROM products WHERE department = 'Industrial'
)
OR price > ANY (
  SELECT price FROM products WHERE department = 'Electronics'
)

-- using only subqueries, print the max price, min price, and average price of all phones.

-- method 1; w/ subqueries
SELECT
  (SELECT MAX(price) FROM phones) AS max_price,
  (SELECT MIN(price) FROM phones) AS min_price,
  (SELECT AVG(price) FROM phones) AS avg_price;


-- method 2; w/o subqueries
SELECT MAX(price) AS max_price, MIN(price) AS min_price, AVG(price) AS avg_price
FROM phones;
```

### Correlated Subqueries

```sql

-- aliases are required for correlated subqueries when using/referencing the same table
-- show the name, department, and price of the most expensive product in each department

-- method 1; using a group by
SELECT name, department, price
FROM products
WHERE price = ANY (
  SELECT MAX(price) FROM products GROUP BY department
)

-- method 2; correlated subquery
SELECT name, department, price
FROM products AS p1
WHERE p1.price = ( -- reminder since conditions check every row, this acts like a loop
  SELECT MAX(price)
  FROM products AS p2
  WHERE p2.department = p1.department
)

-- without using a join or a group by, print the number of orders for each product

-- method 1;
SELECT name, ( -- this subquery returns a full column , merely appended to the final output)
  SELECT COUNT(*)
  FROM orders
  WHERE product_id = products.id -- inner loop checking every order with each one product
) AS order_count
FROM products; -- products acts as the outside loop, so we are looping through each product and checking with every order.

-- method 2 ; using a join and a group by
SELECT
  products.name,
  COUNT(orders.id) AS order_count
FROM
  products
  LEFT JOIN orders ON orders.product_id = products.id
GROUP BY
  products.id
ORDER BY -- we need to order by id since grouping doesn't guarantee order
  products.id;
```

### Distincts

```sql
-- count distinct departments; Can be replaced by GROUP BY but not vice versa (they do different things)

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT department)
FROM products;

-- distinct departments and names; both are distinct unique combinations between the 2 columns; you can no longer apply aggregates on these columns
-- if you want distinct columns and apply aggregates on them, use GROUP BY instead.

SELECT DISTINCT department, name
FROM products;
```

### Greatest and Least

```sql
-- show the name, weight, and the greatest is either 30 as our minimum or twice the weight

SELECT name, weight, GREATEST(30, 2 * weight)
FROM products;

-- all items are on sale! Show the name, weight, and the least is either 400 as our maximum or half the price

SELECT name, price, LEAST(400, price / 2)

```

### Case

If condition is not met, the default value return is a null. case conditions are not that common to use on sql, since we can perform that using if/else statements on the front end.

```sql

-- print each product, the price, and a description of the price. Price > 600 = 'high', price > 300 = 'medium', else 'cheap'

SELECT name, price, CASE
  WHEN price > 600 THEN 'high'
  WHEN price > 300 THEN 'medium'
  ELSE 'cheap'
END
FROM products

```

### Unique

**UNIQUE** works just like **DISTINCT** for queries. If you place it across multiple columns, it will apply unique to those combinations instead of individual ones.

```sql

-- Single column unique constraint
CREATE TABLE table_name (
  column1 VARCHAR(255),
  UNIQUE (column1)
)

-- OR

CREATE TABLE table_name (
  column1 VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE
);

-- Create multi column unique constraint
CREATE TABLE table_name (
  column1 VARCHAR(255),
  column2 VARCHAR(255),
  column3 VARCHAR(255),
  UNIQUE (column1, column2, column3)
);

ALTER TABLE table_name
ADD UNIQUE (column1, column2, column3);
```

### Check

Reminder that check only validates conditions on the same row of every respective row, and never crosses over.

```sql
-- check if est_delivery is greater than created_at
CREATE TABLE orders (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(40) NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  est_delivery TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  CHECK(est_delivery > created_at)
)

-- check if car color is red, green, or blue
CREATE TABLE cars (
	id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
	name VARCHAR(20),
	color VARCHAR(20) CHECK (color IN ('red', 'green', 'blue'))
);
```

## pgAdmin

On PGAdmin, the data type is defaulted to the most appropriate data type, however you can reassign it manually for ex: `SELECT (2::DECIMAL)` and postgres will throw an error if the data type is incorrect / out of range.

To find your tables in database:

1. Schemas
2. Public
3. Tables

We can edit table columns and rows by clicking them, then save on the top with the grid icon.

## pg library

#### Connecting to the database using the pg library:

```js
import { Pool } from "pg";
import "dotenv/config";

const pool = new Pool({
	connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
});

// const pool = new Pool({
//   user: process.env.POSTGRES_USER,
//   host: 'db', // This matches the service name in docker-compose.yml
//   database: process.env.POSTGRES_DB,
//   password: process.env.POSTGRES_PASSWORD,
//   port: 5432,
// });

export default pool;
```

**Client** => single database connection; executes a query one at a time and is synchronous.  
**Pool** => multiple database connections; executes multiple queries at the same time and is asynchronous.

| Feature               | Client                                                              | Pool                                                                       |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Connection Type       | Single, dedicated connection to the database                        | Multiple connections, managed as a pool                                    |
| Connection Management | Manual, must call client.end() to close                             | Automatic, pool manages connections internally                             |
| Use Case              | Suitable for one-off queries or small apps                          | Ideal for apps with many simultaneous queries                              |
| Performance           | Can be slower with many queries due to frequent connection overhead | More efficient with many simultaneous queries due to connection reuse      |
| Overhead              | Higher overhead for each query (opens/closes connection each time)  | Lower overhead as connections are reused                                   |
| Concurrency           | Limited to one query at a time per client instance                  | Allows multiple queries to run concurrently (through multiple connections) |
