# Project Management

## Intro to Project Management

- A project is an individual or collaborative enterprise that is a carefully planned to achieve a particular outcome.
- A Project:
  - Is specific/cannot be vague
  - Requires one-off performance
  - Requires planning
  - Is large enough to need control mechanisms in place
  - Is not a business as usual activity
  - IT team performing regular maintenance (not a project), roll-out of Microsoft Word to all desktops (project), Greece Team Preparing a Bid to Host Olympic Games (project), Olympic Committee choosing winning bid for Olympic Games (not a project; part of their job), Deciding to work on becoming more healthy (not a project)
- Greenfield Projects - new implementation; very new; fresh
- Brownfield Projects - old implementation; based on historical data; bring something forward into a new system; system conversion (streaming service implements a new subscription plan based on their data they have on existing plans)
- Gantt Chart - shows what must be done (activities) and when it should be done (the schedule); a visual representation of the activities to be done. It is a visual tool used to identify the related timing of predecessor and successor activities
- Project Management is the management of all activities required to successfully complete a project. The activities enhance productivity and the control progress. Some of the desired results include:
  - being on time
  - being within budget
  - having appropriate quality
- A project manager (PM) - responsible for managing the process and the activities of project management like:
  - Planning all activities
  - Overseeing all execution
  - Monitoring progress
  - Reporting to stakeholders
- Project Charter - a document that provides formal approval to proceed as a project and outlines the project's:
  - Scope
  - Objective
  - Measurements and assumptions
  - Restrictions
  - Major participants
  - Project Authorities
  - Expected or approved costs
  - Timeframes - deliveries and milestones
  - Key Risks
  - Expectations of the quality of deliverables
- Project Schedule - used for documenting and detailing key milestones, which are defined points in a project's schedule and show the progress achieved: like a list or Gantt Chart, where progress will be measured and compared against the milestone.
  - Agile: A flexible approach to project management.
  - Kanban: A visual method for managing tasks, focusing on workflow.
  - Scrum: A structured Agile framework with specific roles and time-boxed sprints.
  - Jira: A tool that helps teams implement Agile practices, like Scrum and Kanban, by tracking tasks and managing workflows.

- Phases of Project Management (sequential; must be completed in order)
  - Planning - Determine the viability of the investment and object an agreement (project charter) to pay, and plan the control of the project
  - Execution - plan the specifics of the project, and perform all activities to complete a successful project, identify which components will be used and how those components fit together, prototype is verified on planned build, where testing also occurs
  - Implementation - go live with project work product; perform all activities necessary to place product on live environment. Notify the customer/user community of the new product or service.
  - Closure - complete the documentation to close out project
  - **Nine Areas of Attention (each goes through the 4 phases)**
    - Scope - how big or small the project is, how much work, components of this document will include all quality and cost expectations
    - Schedule - document defining timing for all project activities, including delivery, like a Gantt Chart, Trello, Kanban, Jira
    - Cost - expected and actual cost of project
    - Quality - quality of deliverables as they are being designed, built, and delivered
    - Risks (Incident) - Something that might happen (pros and cons)
    - Issues - Something that is happening or has happened (always negative)
    - Stakeholders - who is impacted by the project? People involved in project like fundings
    - Administration - Handles operational, clerical, or support functions; Reports, Paperwork, Meetings, Communication, Purchases
    - Approvals - who is going to approve the project; initial, milestone, completion (acceptance)

---

- Mitigation Strategy - how to mitigate the risks, to lessen or prevent them
- Risk Register - a database or document detailing the risks; document likelihood of occurrence, likely impact if it occurs, response to the risk (mitigation strategy)
- Issue Register - database or document that contains the details of issues
  - Impact of the issue
  - Who 'owns' the issue
  - Estimated resolution time

### Understanding Stakeholders

- Stakeholder - entity with an interest in the outcome of a project.
- Customer (purchaser) - entity that pays for a service or product. The entity determines how valuable the service is.
- End-user / User (consumer) - entity that uses a product or service. The user may or may not be the customer. (like a company needing a product for their employees, the customer is the company, and the end-user is the employees)
- Supplier - entity that provides a service or product used in creation or delivery of product/service to end users. (How do users get the product) Think of them as products you use. (They provide goods, components, or services that support another organization’s service but don’t interact with the end customer directly.)

| Example | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Intel | Supplies CPUs to laptop manufacturers like Dell or Apple. |
| Cisco | Sells network routers and switches used by service providers or internal IT teams. |
| Twilio | Supplies communication APIs (SMS, voice) that other services (e.g., Uber) use. |
| Electric company | Supplies electricity to a data center — not responsible for how services are delivered to end users. |
| Contract developer | Supplies code to a software firm building an app — but isn’t the service provider to the customer. |
| Data center colocation provider | Provides physical space and power for servers, but the customer is served by someone else. |


- Service Provider - entity that provides a service to customers and users to enhance productivity. May be own by the customer or external entity (ex. support chat). They do something for you for the purpose of improvement. (They deliver complete services directly to the customer and are responsible for both utility and warranty.)

| Example | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Microsoft 365 | Provides email, file storage, and productivity apps with uptime guarantees. |
| AWS (when used as cloud host) | Provides infrastructure-as-a-service with SLAs, monitoring, and support. |
| Managed IT Service Companies | Handle IT support, monitoring, patching, and maintenance for client businesses. |
| Google Workspace | Delivers email, docs, calendar, and cloud storage with support and availability. |
| Zoom | Offers video conferencing service with a reliable platform and support. |
| Salesforce | Provides a CRM platform, including system uptime, customer support, and software updates. |


- Determining Stakeholder Level of Involvement
  - Access the influence that a stakeholder could have on project
  - Access the interest that a stakeholder has on the project
  - Assessment can help create a communication plan.
  - Record individuals and level of involvement in RACI matrix
- RACI - Specify responsibilities of stakeholders:
  - Responsible for correct execution
  - Accountable for final result
  - Consulted to provide additional knowledge and information
  - informed or kept up to date regarding progress
- The RACI Matrix/Model is a tool used to identify stakeholders and their involvement in the project or activity (there is only 1 A for each activity)

### What every business wants

- Achieve objective
- Manage Risks
- Have fully utilized resources

- Requirements for Business Success
  - Correctly Understanding Customer Base
  - Delivery of Correct Product/Service
  - Control mechanisms for Delivery - Cost vs Value
  - Preparation for Changing Conditions - Innovation

- Roadblocks to Business Success
  - Time to Market (slower than competitors)
  - Fierce Competition
  - Not responding to Changing Technologies/Conditions

---

### Why should a business fund a project

- Probability of Failure - 70% of all IT projects fail to achieve projected outcomes, 50% of all IT projects fail to achieve outcome and lose 100% of revenue

---

### The Concept of Value (its relative)

- Circumstances
- Needs or wants
- Perception

- Controlling the Perception of Value
  - Value is defined by the customer
  - Affordable mix of features
  - Achievement of Objectives
  - Value changes over time and circumstances
- Utility - functionality offered by product or service to meet a particular need; fit for purpose (improve Customer Performance OR Reduce/Remove Customer Constraints); how well it meets user needs. functionality offered by product or service to meet a particular need;
  - Fit for purpose (works as designed)
  - Improves probability of achieving outcomes
  - Improves customer performance capability
  - Reduces customer constraints
- Warranty - fit for use (guaranteed consistency of delivery; Assurance & Quality of product/service), Decreases Performance Variation (Attributes of the system); Quality of the service or product; how well it meets user needs in terms of performance, reliability, and support. You trust it to be available, supported, and secure.
  - Availability - when needed
  - Capacity - Adequate for business needs
  - IT Service Continuity - Major disruption recovery
  - Security - Are Customer assets secure?
- Value(Service Value) comes from Utility and Warranty (What it does is utility, the quality of what is done is warranty)

---

### Types of Service Providers

- Internal Service Providers - different entities owned by the organization; each individual entity provides services to a single customer; An internal unit within the same organization that provides services exclusively to one business unit.
- Shared Services Unit - provides services to multiple internal customers of the same organization; A service provider that serves multiple business units within the same organization.
- External Service Providers - Provides services to multiple customers, could exist as either internal or external; A third-party or external company that provides services to external customers or multiple organizations.

## Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

- Works effectively (performs its task well)
- Works efficiently (does not cost too much to operate/perform)
- Is inexpensive to maintain
- Is cost-effective to enhance
- Must be produced within time and cost estimates

- SDLC Phases
  - A - Business Analysis - identify the current state (where are we now) - It allows us to identify the needs that need to be fulfilled by our project
    & B - Requirements Analysis - customer describes what they want and how they want it used. (wants (usually unrealistic), needs, extra stuff... (not a big deal)(wants vs need - can vs will pay for))
  - Design - how do we build it? Consider: hardware, software, service/product availability, service/product capacity, security, environmental considerations
    - High-level Design - lists the functional aspects of the various modules, along with the final result (not actually a functional product) (architectural diagram of overall components)
    - Low-Level Design - details the logic and execution of each module in an HLD (wireframes/blueprint)
  - Development/Coding - coding process; using compilers, interpreters, and languages (WHAT WE ARE IN THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS)
  - Testing - testing phase of software quality; test by how well the software meets the standards/requirements (Functional and non-functional). Fit-for-use is from a user perspective and defines whether product is useful for daily usage.
  - Deployment(Implementation) - moves the product/service into the 'live' environment. Once deployed successfully, customers and users can be allowed to use the product/functionally (test environment -> live environment/public)
  - Maintenance - maintenance of the software, ongoing process. Maintenance of hardware/software, updates, upgrades, new features.

- Software Testing
  - UX Testing - can users use the software
  - Functionality Testing - does it work functionally
  - Security Testing - does this release meet the customer's acceptable risk profile.
  - Load Testing - does the service support x number of users and maintain acceptable levels of performance
  - Performance Testing - is the performance from your blueprint the same in a live environment?
  - Compatibility Testing - will your live environment be supported once you release/deploy the software (make sure everything is working together seamlessly)

- End-User Preparation / Training
  - End-users must be trained in how to interact with new systems prior to the new rollout.
  - Not having users ready to interact with the new system is a risk to a successful implementation

---

- Questions:
  - What is the importance of ensuring users are properly trained? **To ensure we have a successful implementation of the software**
  - Why does this training need to occur before rollout?
    **If users are not trained beforehand, they cannot properly interact with the new system and do the appropriate software testing.**
  - What is meant by "deploy into the live environment"?
    **The testing environment is moved into the live environment for the public to use.**
  - What steps are necessary after deployment into the live environment to allow users to utilize the new functionality?
    **Preparation of end-users with training and documentation (other support); Compatibility Testing is necessary to ensure that the new functionality is compatible with the live environment**

Waterfall has the following phases: Planning, Execution, Implementation, Closure


# Software Development Hierarchy


[ SDLC ] — the process of building software  
        ↓  
[ Methodology ] — mindset (e.g., Agile, Waterfall)  
        ↓  
[ Framework ] — practical structure (e.g., Scrum, Kanban)  
        ↓  
[ Tools ] — how you carry it out (e.g., Jira, Trello, Gantt)

🧪 Example:
Let’s say your team is:  
Using Agile (methodology),  
Following the Scrum framework (sprints, roles),  
Managing work in Jira (tool).  

# SDLC

### **==The General Process==**
> What steps should happen to build software?

Its a generic structured life cycle - providing a guideline for every phase for software project. Think of it like a roadmap, blueprint, or recipe.

# Framework 

### **==The Practical Toolbox==** 

> How do we actually carry out those steps in a practical way? Using what tools? 

A framework provides: 
- Roles 
- Rituals / Activities
- Artifacts
- Rules 

Some frameworks include: 
- Scrum
- Kanban

Tools used to support/carry out these frameworks include:
- Jira
- Trello
- Asana
- GitHub
- Gantt Chart
