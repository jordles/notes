# Trees

a data structure that stores data in a hierarchical way. It represents a collection of elements called nodes, connected by edges called links or branches that form a tree-like structure. It allows you to store and retrieve data in constant time. It also allows you to delete and update data in constant time.

**Full trees** either has no children (leaf node) or exactly two children. 

**Perfect Tree** - Full + Balance 
Balance - All the leaf nodes are at the same level (distance from the root) This means the tree is completely filled with no gaps at any level. 


**Complete Tree** - 
Almost Full Levels - All levels except possibly the last one are completely filled with nodes.
Left Leaning Last Level - The last level is filled with nodes from the left side as much as possible. There might be empty spaces on the right side. 

[Binary Search Tree (BST)](<Binary Search Tree>) - a type of binary tree used to organize data in a sorted way. It works like a filing cabinet where you can efficiently search, add, or remove items.

[Breadth First Search (BFS)](<Breadth First Search>) - an algorithm that explores/searches the entire tree level by level. The running time is linear.
